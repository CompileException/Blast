/*! \page pageimporter ApexImporter

ApexImporter is a tool for converting destructible assets from APEX Destruction format to Blast&tm; asset format.  Whereas APEX Destruction only needs a
list of connected chunks, Blast&tm; has a Bond structure to describe chunk connections.  Each Bond describes the interface between two chunks, and needs
the area, centroid, and average normal of this interface.  ApexImporter computes this data automatically.  Interface search can be done in several ways:
- <b>Exact mode</b>: Importer tries to find triangles from two chunks which lay in common surface. If such triangles are found, their intersections are considered as the interface. Such an interface may not exist.
- <b>Forced mode</b>: This mode is based on search for midplane between two chunks and intersecting them with offsetted midplane to find interface parameters. Creates bonds even if chunks have no common surface.


A bond is not created if the area of interface is zero.  The interface centroid is computed as center of mass of all interface polygon points.  The interface normal is computed as an average of normals of all planes comprising the interface surface.

Note - for Blast&tm; to operate with satisfactory fracturing behavior, it does not require exact area, centroid, and normal values for Bonds.

Along with creating a Blast&tm; asset, ApexImporter creates an *.obj or *.fbx file with description of chunk render geometry.  Blast&tm; asset data can be saved to *.llasset, *.tkasset or *.bpxa format. BPXA asset contains collision geometry and can be used in \ref pagesampleassetviewer.
