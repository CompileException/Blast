/*! \page pageextapeximport Apex Import (NvBlastExtApexImport)

Blast extensions provide Nv::Blast::ApexImporter::ApexImportTool, which can be used for converting APEX Destructible assets into Blast assets.

This tool supports two bond generation modes and can be configured by providing: 
\code
struct ApexImporterConfig
{
	enum InterfaceSearchMode { EXACT, FORCED, MODE_COUNT };
	InterfaceSearchMode infSearchMode;
}
\endcode

1) EXACT - Importer tries to find triangles from two chunks which lay in common surface. If such triangles are found, their intersections are considered as the interface.

2) FORCED - Bond creation is forced no matter how far chunks from each other. Interface parameters are approximated.

Nv::Blast::ApexImporter::ApexImportTool can be itinialized by providing ApexSDK and ModuleDestructible, or they can be created internally.

If ApexSDK and ModuleDestructible were provided, they are not freed when Nv::Blast::ApexImporter::~ApexImportTool() is called.
