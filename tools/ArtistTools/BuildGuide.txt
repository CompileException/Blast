Before building the viewer you should run the script that generates source code for serialization. This can be found here

p4\sw\devrel\libdev\HairWorks\1.2\trunk\tools\FurViewer\source\App\Parameters

Run the script go.bat

You should now be able to build using one of the Visual Studio projects


Is currently using Qt5.5. You may need to configure the variable QTDIR to point to the appropriate project. You will see errors in the post build step complaining about switches if you don't do this. 

On my system the variable points to...

p4\sw\sw\devrel\libdev\HairWorks\1.2\trunk\external\Qt5.5.0\vc2013

Visual Studio 2013
------------------

The project is in project\vs2013

Open the project FurViewer.sln

Visual Studio 2015
------------------

The project is in project\vs2013

There are two projects FurViewer.sln - builds the Dx11 viewer, FurViewerDx12.sln builds the Direct3D12 version of the viewer.
